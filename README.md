AuthDB
======
Script and custom MySQL database user authentication plugin for CraftBukkit.

Compiling
---------
You need to have Maven installed (http://maven.apache.org). Once installed,
simply run:

    mvn clean package install
    
Maven will automatically download dependencies for you. Note: For that to work,
be sure to add Maven to your "PATH".

Contributing
------------
We happily accept contributions. The best way to do this is to fork AuthDB
on GitHub, add your changes, and then submit a pull request. We'll look at it,
make comments, and merge it into AuthDB if everything works out.
